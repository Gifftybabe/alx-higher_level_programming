# Python - Everything is object

In Python, almost everything is an object, whether a number, a function, or a module. Python is using a pure object model where classes are instances of a meta-class “type” in Python, the terms “type” and “class” are synonyms. And “type” is the only class that is an instance of itself. This object model can be useful when we want information about a particular resource in Python. Except for the Python keywords like “if def, globals”, using type(<name>) or dir(<name>) or just typing the resource name and pressing enter- it will work on pretty much anything. Let’s make it clear what this statement means “Everything in Python is an object”.

# Background Context
Now that we understand that everything is an object and have a little bit of knowledge, let’s pause and look a little bit closer at how Python works with different types of objects.

BTW, have you ever modified a variable without knowing it or wanting to?

## 0x0F. Python - Object-relational mapping

An object-relational mapper (ORM) is a code library that automates the transfer of data stored in relational database tables into objects that are more commonly used in application code.

# Key Benefits of ORM 
Here are the common benefits of using ORM: 

- Productivity
A standard application often has a sizable part of data access code, and the time required to write such code might require a significant portion of the overall development time. The amount of code is unlikely to be decreased when using an ORM tool—in fact, it might even increase—but the ORM tool produces the entire data access code automatically based on the data model you specify in just a few seconds.

- Simplicity
Developers frequently employ ORM because of its simplicity in managing database queries. The developer must first write codes and queries using compatible and preferred programming languages. The written code snippet could be difficult to update and might not support older operating systems. ORM can be employed to retain the code’s fluency in order to write any OOP language.

Additionally, ORM can minimise the codebase’s complexity when many SQL queries are used to access the database. Other developers benefit from being able to recognise and comprehend the code. As a result, application maintenance is simpler and quicker than it was in the earlier stage.

- Application Design
An effective ORM tool created by highly skilled software architects will include design patterns that practically require you to apply sound programming conventions in an application. As a result, application layer development can proceed concurrently and in parallel with clear concern separation and autonomous development.

- Code Reuse
The data objects can be used in numerous apps if you construct a class library to produce a separate DLL for ORM-generated data access code. This eliminates the requirement for any data access code in any of the apps that utilise the class library.

- Maintaining Application
You generally don’t need to bother about testing the code extensively because all of the code created by the ORM is presumably well-tested. Obviously, you must ensure that the code fulfils your requirements, but an ORM that is widely used is likely to have code that many engineers of all levels have contributed to. Long-term changes to the model definition or database schema won’t have an impact on how the application utilises the data objects.

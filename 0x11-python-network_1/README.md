Python provides two levels of access to network services. At a low level, you can access the basic socket support in the underlying operating system, which allows you to implement clients and servers for both connection-oriented and connectionless protocols.

How do I connect to a network in Python?
- Step 1: First of all, we will import the required libraries. 
- Step 2: Secondly, we will scan and display all the available SSIDs using the cmd commands and a Python library known as OS. 
- Step 3: We will then select the known Wi-Fi network to connect to and wait until it connects successfully.

# Python
Welcome to the Python world!

The first projects are more "C-oriented" - no tricks, no funky syntax - simple!
If you've already played with Python, don't worry, fun things will come.
You'll soon find that with Python (and the majority of higher level languages), there are ten different ways to do the same thing. Some tasks will expect only one implementation, while other tasks will have multiple possible implementations.
Like C, Python also has a linter / style guide like Betty, called PEP8, also now known as PyCode.

Enjoy!

## SOLID Coding in Python

The principle of SOLID coding is an acronym originated by Robert C. Martin, and it stands for five different conventions of coding.

If you follow, these principles you can improve the reliability of your code by working on its structure and its logical consistency.

The SOLID principles are:

-----The Single-Responsibility Principle (SRP)

-----The Open-Closed Principle (OCP)

-----The Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)

-----The Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)

------The Dependency inversion Principle (DIP)
